# CSC 226: Algorithms and Data Structures II

## Course Overview
This course is the continuation of Algorithms and Data Structures I (CSC 225). Students will learn a variety of important data structures, algorithms, and algorithm design techniques. Relevant mathematical concepts are an integral part of this course.

This course includes:

    • Advanced techniques for design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and data structures
    • Algorithmic design paradigms: greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, randomization
    • Advanced Analysis techniques: amortization and expected running time
    • Advanced data structures: random hash families, disjoint sets
    • Advanced graph algorithms: network flow, connectivity, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths
    • Mathematical tools: graphs and digraphs, graph properties, planar graphs, networks
    • String search
    • Data compression
